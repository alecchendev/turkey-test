# ðŸ¦ƒ Turkey Test

### Motivation
My original idea came from the recent progress in language models. I
wanted to see if we could crowdsource turing tests
in a more controlled environment that could also used to evaluate
language models.

If you really stress a system, you may not be fooled,
but I think it's interesting to see how well a system can fool
people in a more natural setting. I think it will also just be fun for
people to actually try it for themselves and see how they do!

In the future, I think it would be cool if there were a platform for ML
researchers to run experiments in the form of games like this.
I guess they probably do that through user/telemetry data already.
Nevertheless, a thought.

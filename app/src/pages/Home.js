        Hey there! Welcome to Turkey Test, a game where you can play as an
        investigator or a responder.
      </p>
      <p> 
        As an investigator, you're matched up randomly with either an AI or a
        human responder, and you're allowed to ask 3 questions before guessing
        which one you're talking to. As a responder you answer the
        investigator's questions however you would like.
      </p>
      <p>
        In theory, this website is meant to crowdsource turing tests for language models.
